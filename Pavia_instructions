1. Please install the following software:

- R from https://cran.r-project.org/
- RStudio (free version) from https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/
- Useful, but not absolutely necessary: Notepad++ from https://notepad-plus-plus.org/download/v7.7.1.html

2. After you have installed RStudio, please install the package udpipe and download several models, to save time:

- Open RStudio, go to the Packages tab (bottom right panel), click on "Install"" and type udpipe. Press "Install". The add-on package udpipe will be installed.
- Next, run the following commands in the Console (bottom left panel):
model_eng <- udpipe_download_model(language = "english")
model_fin <- udpipe_download_model(language = "finnish")
model_ita <- udpipe_download_model(language = "italian")

(and possibly other languages that interest you)

Also, please install the add-on package readr using the same method.

3. Save somewhere locally all text files in the archive (and please remember the directory).

4. Please download the Universal Dependencies corpora v2.4 from 
https://lindat.mff.cuni.cz/repository/xmlui/handle/11234/1-2988 and extract the files somewhere. Only the treebanks will be needed (no documentation and no tools).
